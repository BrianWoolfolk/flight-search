# Run the app

You need to have `Docker` installed and `Docker Compose` for this app.

After downloading the whole project. Run:

> `docker-compose up --build`

To start the images from both Backend & Frontend.

# Usage

Once the project is created and running via `docker-compose`,
you can see all the detailed info inside: `localhost:3000`.

You will find all the application characteristics and controls.

# Notes

Because security, the application as it is right now would not function properly
because the `.env` files are missing.

If you want to know about these files, all detailed info would be in the Email.
